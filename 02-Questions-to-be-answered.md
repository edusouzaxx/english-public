### 5. ❓ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ?

> When I think about my strengths, the first one that comes to mind — and this was a significant part of my promotion feedback to Specialist — is **Reliability and a Sense of Ownership**. This means that if a mission or responsibility is entrusted to me, you can be confident I will give it my absolute best "

> Beyond that, my deep **Technical Expertise** in DevOps, cloud technologies, and containerization, coupled with strong problem-solving abilities and a proactive initiative, are strengths I consistently leverage. 

> I'm also highly committed to **Continuous Learning** to stay current. I really enjoy learning new things in these kinds of environments. I like to learn on my own. For example, I maintain a subscription on the Udemy course platform so I can learn any new skill I need, whenever I want. I also like to get professional certifications to prove what I've learned."

> "Regarding my weaknesses, something I'm actively improving, and which has  become a passion, is communication and public speaking. While I feel confident presenting technical details and discussing complex ideas in technical forums. But my goal now is to go further and be capable of transforming complex ideas into simple, but impactful messages for any audience. I see communication as a 'superpower,' and I'm convinced that honing this skill will take me to the next professional level."

### 6. ❓ What is your experience with OpenShift?

> "My experience with OpenShift is quite extensive, as I've been involved since the very beginning of our journey into container processing, DevOps pipelines, and microservices deployment at my current company."

> "In the early stages, we evaluated various container orchestration platforms and the diverse open-source tools and technologies necessary to run containerized workloads at an enterprise scale. 

> It was a significant learning curve, but we successfully established a corporate environment and a pipeline for creating microservices, which really helped accelerate innovation."

> "Over time, to enhance the reliability and robustness of our environment, we began adopting enterprise-grade solutions. 

> Among these, we selected Red Hat OpenShift, which is now our official on-premises platform for running containerized workloads."

> "Today, due to the sheer volume of workloads and the number of solutions migrating to this containerized environment, I operate within an ecosystem of nearly 100 OpenShift clusters. 

> These are distributed across two main datacenters, which presents a significant operational and management challenge."

> "Given this scale, I've been deeply involved in defining and implementing robust standardization for cluster creation and lifecycle management. 

> This critical initiative encompasses establishing consistent, templated configurations for aspects like networking, storage classes, RBAC, and logging/monitoring agents. 


> It also involves enforcing stringent security policies, such as network policies and Pod Security Standards, and codifying operational procedures across this vast, distributed landscape."

> "This approach primarily leverages automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles – often using tools like Terraform or Crossplane for declarative provisioning – and GitOps practices, for instance, using Argo CD for continuous reconciliation. 

> This methodology ensures not only unparalleled consistency and reliability by minimizing configuration drift but also drives highly efficient operations, significantly reducing manual overhead and accelerating the time-to-provisioning for new environments."

> "Beyond the management aspects, I have deep familiarity with core Kubernetes primitives such as Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, and Routes, as well as ConfigMaps and Secrets for application configuration and sensitive data management.

> A significant part of my focus has been on optimizing resource utilization through ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges, and ensuring application resilience with Probes, like liveness and readiness probes."

> "Furthermore, I am consistently involved in troubleshooting efforts, incident response, and crisis management related to our OpenShift environment, which has given me a very practical, hands-on understanding of its intricacies."

> "So, my experience spans from the initial strategy and implementation to the day-to-day operational management and optimization of a large-scale OpenShift deployment."

### 7. ❓ Have you worked with IBM Power or AIX?

> Yes, I’ve supported AIX systems in banking environments.  
> I’ve done patching, system tuning, logical volume management, and handled performance issues.  
> I also understand PowerVM and HMC administration, and I’ve integrated AIX systems with Linux-based tools for monitoring and automation.

---

### 8. ❓ How do you handle pressure or critical incidents?

> In high-pressure situations, I stay calm and follow a structured approach.  
> I gather logs, isolate the issue, and apply a temporary fix to restore service.  
> Then I do a root cause analysis and implement a permanent solution to avoid repetition.

---

### 9. ❓ Why do you want to work in Europe / at our bank?

> I see this opportunity as a long-term career step.  
> I want to bring my experience in infrastructure and automation to a global team.  
> I'm also motivated to grow in a multicultural environment, contribute to innovation, and offer stability for my family in Europe.

### 10. ❓ Can you describe a significant project or initiative you led that delivered tangible benefits to the organization? What was the challenge, what was your approach, and what were the results?"

> "Yes, certainly. A good example is when I led the effort to define and implement a monitoring solution for our container environment. 
> At that time, we didn't have enterprise tools like OpenShift yet. We were using open-source Kubernetes managed with Rancher Community. 

> First, I evaluated different tools and then standardized our monitoring stack. A key improvement I introduced was a centralized interface. This allowed us to see metrics and dashboards from all clusters in one place. This reduced the team's operational workload as they didn't need to open many different interfaces to get an overview of the environment.

> The centralized view helped us see our overall **efficiency**. We found we only used about 20% of our allocated resources. So, we set a goal (an OKR) to reach 40% usage. We did it. This brought real savings in resources, licenses, and money."

> Next, we developed an alert system and integrated it into the company's ITSM tool, which enabled automatic incident creation. We also trained our L1 and L2 support teams (who work twenty-four seven). This connected our container environment to the main company support process and significantly reduced escalations to the engineering team.

> The standardized monitoring also gave us the ability to enrich the environment metrics with various metadata, allowing the **finops** team to accurately calculate the cost of the workloads running in the environment. They could then show these costs back to the development teams and their managers. This made everyone more careful about how they used resources, leading to even more savings.

> So, this initiative, which I led, brought clear, measurable benefits in terms of efficiency, cost reduction, and better support processes. 

---

### 11. ❓ "Why should we hire you?" / "What makes you a good fit for this role?"

> First, you can trust me. I believe trust is fundamental in any relationship, including work. When I take on a task, I have a strong sense of ownership and I'm committed to getting it done right. You can be confident that I will give my best.

> Second, I bring deep technical expertise, especially with technologies used in the banking industry. With over 25 years in IT, much of it in banking, I understand the specific challenges and how to solve them effectively using modern solutions like OpenShift and cloud technologies.

> Third, I have a proven ability to not only manage complex modern infrastructures, like large-scale OpenShift environments, but also to drive improvements and deliver real results. My experience with the monitoring project, for example, shows how I can lead initiatives that bring tangible benefits like cost savings and increased efficiency.

> I'm confident I can bring this same dedication, problem-solving ability, and value to your team and help you achieve your goals."
