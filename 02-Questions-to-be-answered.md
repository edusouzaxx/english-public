### 3. ❓ Career path

> My career has been almost entirely built within the technological environment of the banking industry. 

> For a decade early in my career, I specialized in banking automation. I worked on the installation and maintenance of banking systems and equipment for bank branches.  This experience gave me a deep understanding of the day-to-day operations of those on the front line who are doing business."

> After that, I worked briefly for a family software company before quickly returning to the market, joining a public-private bank through a public selection process and is my current job.

> In my current employment, I worked for about seven years with High-Performance Computing (HPC), including IBM Power and Oracle Sparc systems, as well as UNIX systems like Linux, AIX, and Solaris. 
> This foundation in Linux, was crucial for my success when I transitioned to working with containers and cloud technologies."

> "Over the last six years, my focus has shifted to cloud-native technologies, with a strong emphasis on container processing, specializing in Kubernetes platforms like OpenShift and related cloud technologies, tools and infrastructure.

> Over the past two years, I have taken on the role of Container Processing Infrastructure Specialist, serving as the company's technical point of reference in this domain. 

> My core responsibilities involve defining, supporting, and improving container-based processing architectures. 

> I am fequently involved in incident resolution and crisis management.

### 5. ❓ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? "Why should we hire you?" / "What makes you a good fit for this role?"

> "I'd highlight three core strengths that I believe are particularly relevant.

> First, **Trust and Sense of Ownership**. For me, trust is non-negotiable; it's the foundation of any relationship, professional or personal.This was the feedback I received from my manager on my last promotion to specialist . It means if you entrust me with a mission or a task, you can sleep peacefully.  If something is my responsibility, it gets done, and done well.

> "Second is a **Drive for continuous improvement and proactivity**. I'm 'restless' in a positive sense, always seeking to optimize, learn, and enhance. If work becomes routine, I'll find or ask for new challenges. I'm a regular user of learning platforms like Udemy, constantly self-studying."

> Third, **Technical Knowledge and Problem Solving**. I believe there are often multiple paths to a solution, but the crucial part is identifying the optimal path. This means not only making it work, but designing it with security, availability, usability, and scalability in mind from the start. It’s about putting yourself in the shoes of the customer – whether internal or external – to ensure the best solution is delivered.

> "Regarding my weaknesses, something I'm actively improving, and which has become a passion, is **communication and public speaking**. 

> I feel confident presenting technical details and discussing complex ideas in technical forums. 

> But my goal now is to go further and be capable of transforming complex ideas into simple, but impactful messages for any audience. 

> I see communication as a 'superpower,' and I'm convinced that improving this skill will take me to the next professional level."

### 6. ❓ What is your experience with OpenShift?

> "My experience with OpenShift is quite extensive, as I've been involved since the very beginning of our journey into container processing, DevOps pipelines, and microservices deployment at my current company."

> "In the early stages, we evaluated various container orchestration platforms and the diverse open-source tools and technologies necessary to run containerized workloads at an enterprise scale. 

> It was a significant learning curve, but we successfully established a corporate environment and a pipeline for creating microservices, which really helped accelerate innovation."

> "Over time, to enhance the reliability and robustness of our environment, we began adopting enterprise-grade solutions. 

> Among these, we selected Red Hat OpenShift, which is now our official on-premises platform for running containerized workloads."

> "Today, due to the sheer volume of workloads and the number of solutions migrating to this containerized environment, I operate within an ecosystem of nearly 100 OpenShift clusters. 

> These are distributed across two main datacenters, which presents a significant operational and management challenge."

> "Given this scale, I've been deeply involved in defining and implementing robust standardization for cluster creation and lifecycle management. 

> This critical initiative encompasses establishing consistent, templated configurations for aspects like networking, storage classes, RBAC, and logging/monitoring agents. 


> It also involves enforcing stringent security policies, such as network policies and Pod Security Standards, and codifying operational procedures across this vast, distributed landscape."

> "This approach primarily leverages automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles – often using tools like Terraform or Crossplane for declarative provisioning – and GitOps practices, for instance, using Argo CD for continuous reconciliation. 

> This methodology ensures not only unparalleled consistency and reliability by minimizing configuration drift but also drives highly efficient operations, significantly reducing manual overhead and accelerating the time-to-provisioning for new environments."

> "Beyond the management aspects, I have deep familiarity with core Kubernetes primitives such as Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, and Routes, as well as ConfigMaps and Secrets for application configuration and sensitive data management.

> A significant part of my focus has been on optimizing resource utilization through ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges, and ensuring application resilience with Probes, like liveness and readiness probes."

> "Furthermore, I am consistently involved in troubleshooting efforts, incident response, and crisis management related to our OpenShift environment, which has given me a very practical, hands-on understanding of its intricacies."

> "So, my experience spans from the initial strategy and implementation to the day-to-day operational management and optimization of a large-scale OpenShift deployment."

### 7. ❓ Have you worked with IBM Power or AIX?

> Yes, I’ve supported AIX systems in banking environments.  
> I’ve done patching, system tuning, logical volume management, and handled performance issues.  
> I also understand PowerVM and HMC administration, and I’ve integrated AIX systems with Linux-based tools for monitoring and automation.

---

### 8. ❓ How do you handle pressure or critical incidents?

> In high-pressure situations, I stay calm and follow a structured approach.  
> I gather logs, isolate the issue, and apply a temporary fix to restore service.  
> Then I do a root cause analysis and implement a permanent solution to avoid repetition.

### 9. ❓ Can you describe a significant project or initiative you led that delivered tangible benefits to the organization? What was the challenge, what was your approach, and what were the results?"

> **(Situation)** 
> "In the beginning, there was no centralized view of monitoring, it was necessary to check cluster by cluster, which led to operational inefficiencies and difficulty in detecting problems."

> **(Task)** 
> My task was to design and implement a standardized monitoring and alerting stack. 

> **(Action)** 
> "I led the design and implementation of our centralized, standardized monitoring and alerting system using Thanos, Prometheus and Grafana, integrating it with our ITSM. This included tool research, architecture definition and deployment oversight. I also provided L1/L2 support training. A key improvement was the enrichment of metrics with metadata, enabling efficiency tracking per application and supporting our FinOps strategy."

> **(Result)** 
> This resulted in significantly reduced operational overhead, faster incident resolution, a 60% reduction in escalations to engineering, and ultimately, an increase in overall resource usage efficiency from 20% to 40%, leading to real cost savings." 

> This monitoring stack is a core strategic tool and is continuously improved."

### 11. ❓Question: "How do you handle working under pressure or tight deadlines?" (Pergunta: "Como você lida com trabalho sob pressão ou prazos apertados?")

Answer:

"I handle pressure by staying calm and focused on a structured approach. First, I prioritize tasks based on urgency and impact. I break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Clear communication with the team is also key to manage expectations and coordinate efforts. My experience in crisis management and incident resolution in banking has taught me to think clearly and act decisively even in high-stakes situations. For instance, when an incident occurs, I follow a methodical process of gathering data, isolating the issue, applying a fix, and then performing a thorough root cause analysis." (Lido com a pressão mantendo a calma e o foco em uma abordagem estruturada. Primeiro, priorizo as tarefas com base na urgência e no impacto. Divido grandes tarefas em etapas menores e gerenciáveis. A comunicação clara com a equipe também é fundamental para gerenciar expectativas e coordenar esforços. Minha experiência em gerenciamento de crises e resolução de incidentes na área bancária me ensinou a pensar com clareza e agir de forma decisiva mesmo em situações de alto risco. Por exemplo, quando ocorre um incidente, sigo um processo metódico de coleta de dados, isolamento do problema, aplicação de uma correção e, em seguida, realização de uma análise de causa raiz completa.)
