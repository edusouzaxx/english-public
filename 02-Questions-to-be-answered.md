> I will always be grateful for the opportunities I had there.

> I am very proud to have been part of the team that created the container processing environment from scratch.
>  Today we have important workloads running on it, such as PIX (instant payment), the website front end and the intranet, for example. But there are thousands of microservices.
 
> A friend who works at Redhat in another country told me a few days ago that they consider this environment, one of the most mature in the world.

> On the other hand, the company has the government as its majority shareholder, and therefore, political factors can influence careers, especially at higher levels. 

> And that's why I decided to look for new opportunities in the market even giving up the stability that this job offers.

> And I feel comfortable with that, because I've always been concerned with training people to replace me. 

> This allowed me to advance in my career or move to new opportunities ,ensuring minimal impact for the team and for the company.

> "My managers, collegues, see my leaving as a loss, but, as friends, they are supporting me with this decision and opportunity
> And this support has been important to me.

> I believe this opportunity with J Safra Sarasin, aligns with my current career aspirations.

### 5. ❓ What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses ? "Why should we hire you?" / "What makes you a good fit for this role?"


> First, **Trust and Sense of Ownership**. For me, trust is the foundation of any relationship, professional or personal.

> Not by chance, this was the focus of the feedback I received on my last promotion at work to specialist . 

> It means if you entrust me with a mission or a task, you can sleep peacefully, because I will do my best.

> And even if something goes wrong, you'll be the first to know.



> "Second, **Continuous improvement**. 

> I'm always looking to optimize, learn and improve something, whether at work or in my personal life

> If work becomes routine, I'll find or ask for new challenges. 

> I'm a regular user of learning platforms like Udemy."


> Third, **Technical Knowledge and Problem Solving**. 
> Without talking about specific technologies.
> I believe that there are always several ways to solve the same problem.
> But the crucial part is to identify the best solution. 
> Is not about making it work in any way, but in the best way. 
> It's about seeing things from the customer's perspective – to ensure the best solution is delivered.
> Except in cases of incidents where services need to be restored as quickly as possible. 
> And even in these cases, it is important to do a good post-mortem to to avoid the same problem in the future.



> "Regarding my weaknesses, something I'm actively improving, and which has become a passion, is **communication and public speaking**. 

> I feel confident presenting technical details and discussing complex ideas in technical forums. 

> But my goal now is to go further and be capable of transforming complex ideas into simple, but impactful messages for any audience. 

> I see communication as a 'superpower,' and I'm convinced that improving this skill will take me to the next professional level."

### 6. ❓ What is your experience with OpenShift?

> "My experience with OpenShift is quite extensive, as I've been involved since the very beginning of our journey into container processing, DevOps pipelines, and microservices deployment at my current company."

> "In the early stages, we evaluated various container orchestration platforms and the diverse open-source tools and technologies necessary to run containerized workloads at an enterprise scale. 

> It was a significant learning curve, but we successfully established a corporate environment and a pipeline for creating microservices, which really helped accelerate innovation."

> "Over time, to enhance the reliability and robustness of our environment, we began adopting enterprise-grade solutions. 

> Among these, we selected Red Hat OpenShift, which is now our official on-premises platform for running containerized workloads."

> "Today, due to the sheer volume of workloads and the number of solutions migrating to this containerized environment, I operate within an ecosystem of nearly 100 OpenShift clusters. 

> These are distributed across two main datacenters, which presents a significant operational and management challenge."

> "Given this scale, I've been deeply involved in defining and implementing robust standardization for cluster creation and lifecycle management. 

> This critical initiative encompasses establishing consistent, templated configurations for aspects like networking, storage classes, RBAC, and logging/monitoring agents. 


> It also involves enforcing stringent security policies, such as network policies and Pod Security Standards, and codifying operational procedures across this vast, distributed landscape."

> "This approach primarily leverages automation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles – often using tools like Terraform or Crossplane for declarative provisioning – and GitOps practices, for instance, using Argo CD for continuous reconciliation. 

> This methodology ensures not only unparalleled consistency and reliability by minimizing configuration drift but also drives highly efficient operations, significantly reducing manual overhead and accelerating the time-to-provisioning for new environments."

> "Beyond the management aspects, I have deep familiarity with core Kubernetes primitives such as Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, and Routes, as well as ConfigMaps and Secrets for application configuration and sensitive data management.

> A significant part of my focus has been on optimizing resource utilization through ResourceQuotas and LimitRanges, and ensuring application resilience with Probes, like liveness and readiness probes."

> "Furthermore, I am consistently involved in troubleshooting efforts, incident response, and crisis management related to our OpenShift environment, which has given me a very practical, hands-on understanding of its intricacies."

> "So, my experience spans from the initial strategy and implementation to the day-to-day operational management and optimization of a large-scale OpenShift deployment."

### 7. ❓ Have you worked with IBM Power or AIX?

> Yes, I’ve supported AIX systems in banking environments.  
> I’ve done patching, system tuning, logical volume management, and handled performance issues.  
> I also understand PowerVM and HMC administration, and I’ve integrated AIX systems with Linux-based tools for monitoring and automation.

---

### 8. ❓ How do you handle pressure or critical incidents?

> In high-pressure situations, I stay calm and follow a structured approach.  
> I gather logs, isolate the issue, and apply a temporary fix to restore service.  
> Then I do a root cause analysis and implement a permanent solution to avoid repetition.

### 9. ❓ Can you describe a significant project or initiative you led that delivered tangible benefits to the organization? What was the challenge, what was your approach, and what were the results?"

> **(Situation)** 
> "In the beginning, there was no centralized view of monitoring, it was necessary to check cluster by cluster, which led to operational inefficiencies and difficulty in detecting problems."

> **(Task)** 
> My task was to design and implement a standardized monitoring and alerting stack. 

> **(Action)** 
> "I led the design and implementation of our centralized, standardized monitoring and alerting system using Thanos, Prometheus and Grafana, integrating it with our ITSM. This included tool research, architecture definition and deployment oversight. I also provided L1/L2 support training. A key improvement was the enrichment of metrics with metadata, enabling efficiency tracking per application and supporting our FinOps strategy."

> **(Result)** 
> This resulted in significantly reduced operational overhead, faster incident resolution, a 60% reduction in escalations to engineering, and ultimately, an increase in overall resource usage efficiency from 20% to 40%, leading to real cost savings." 

> This monitoring stack is a core strategic tool and is continuously improved."

### 11. ❓Question: "How do you handle working under pressure or tight deadlines?" (Pergunta: "Como você lida com trabalho sob pressão ou prazos apertados?")

Answer:

"I handle pressure by staying calm and focused on a structured approach. First, I prioritize tasks based on urgency and impact. I break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps. Clear communication with the team is also key to manage expectations and coordinate efforts. My experience in crisis management and incident resolution in banking has taught me to think clearly and act decisively even in high-stakes situations. For instance, when an incident occurs, I follow a methodical process of gathering data, isolating the issue, applying a fix, and then performing a thorough root cause analysis." (Lido com a pressão mantendo a calma e o foco em uma abordagem estruturada. Primeiro, priorizo as tarefas com base na urgência e no impacto. Divido grandes tarefas em etapas menores e gerenciáveis. A comunicação clara com a equipe também é fundamental para gerenciar expectativas e coordenar esforços. Minha experiência em gerenciamento de crises e resolução de incidentes na área bancária me ensinou a pensar com clareza e agir de forma decisiva mesmo em situações de alto risco. Por exemplo, quando ocorre um incidente, sigo um processo metódico de coleta de dados, isolamento do problema, aplicação de uma correção e, em seguida, realização de uma análise de causa raiz completa.)
