Sometimes I work with legacy systems that are outdated. I help modernize them step-by-step, improving reliability and reducing technical debt. This requires both patience and strategy.

27.  
When planning a cloud migration, I first identify what can be lifted and shifted, and what needs to be re-architected. Each application has different requirements and risks.

28.  
I often use Linux as my main operating system. I’m very comfortable with the command line and shell scripting. It’s a powerful environment for system tasks and automation.
