Dear Eduardo,
Thank you for letting us know.
It looks like Tuesday, 10th June works well for all the interview participants. Please could you kindly check your flight options for this date?
Once we have the total cost, we will then need to approve the travel expenses. We cover two nights at a hotel in Basel.
Please do not book anything before confirming the price to us and receiving our ok to proceed.
I also wanted to check with you that you do not require a visa and that you have a valid passport as well? Just to make sure this is not an issue.
Lastly, we have another bank holiday tomorrow, so we will most likely get back to you on Friday.
Thanks so much for your cooperation with this.
Kind regards,
Michelle Oester

Dear Eduardo,
Please note that I’ll be leaving the office soon and I won’t have access to my emails until Monday. To avoid price changes, it’s best to book the flights before the weekend, if possible.
If the total cost of the round-trip flight is under CHF 1’100.00, please feel free to go ahead and book the flights to Basel.
If you wish to stay longer, that is no problem for us, but please keep in mind that we can only cover up to CHF 1’100.00 for the flights and pay for two nights at a hotel (up to CHF 140.00 per night).
We can then look at accommodation next week, but I think it’s important to secure the flights as soon as possible.
Have a good weekend.

Dear Eduardo,
Thanks for letting us know you booked the flight!
For the accommodation you are also free to choose the hotel you would like to stay at. We will cover two nights at a hotel (up to CHF 140.00 per night).
We recommend using a website such as Booking.com to compare the different options. Our office is located on Elisabethenstrasse 62, which is very close to the railway station and close to the city centre. Many of the hotels located in the city centre are within walking distance to our office. When you stay at a hotel in Basel, you also get a free BaselCard included with your stay, which allows free travel on public transportation as well. Please see the link below for more information:

Once you have booked your accommodation as well, we kindly ask you to please send us the following details:
Receipts for the flights and the hotel
Your bank details (IBAN, SWIFT/BIC) and your full name and address linked to the bank account
