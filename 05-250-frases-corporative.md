### Plano de Treinamento Rápido

1.  **Não Tente Aprender Tudo de Uma Vez:** Foque em uma categoria por semana.
2.  **Leia e Ouça:** Leia a frase em português e em inglês. Use o Google Tradutor ou um site como o [YouGlish](https://youglish.com/){target="_blank"} para ouvir a pronúncia correta da frase inteira em contextos reais.
3.  **Repita em Voz Alta:** Repita a frase várias vezes. Tente copiar a entonação e o ritmo que você ouviu. Isso treina sua memória muscular vocal.
4.  **Crie Variações:** Tente mudar uma ou duas palavras na frase para adaptá-la a outra situação. Exemplo: "I'll send you the report by the end of the day" -> "I'll send you the *email* by *5 PM*".
5.  **Pratique o "Shadowing":** Coloque um vídeo ou áudio de uma reunião ou apresentação em inglês e tente falar *junto* com o locutor, imitando-o em tempo real. Isso é extremamente poderoso para fluidez.
