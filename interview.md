## Sample questions and answers for an interview in English

### 1. What are your strengths?

Employers ask this question to help the interviewer understand your abilities and qualifications specific to the position. To properly answer this question, research the position and determine the necessary qualities to perform well in the role. Then, tailor your answer to focus on strengths related to the job and show you're capable of adding value to the position and the company as a whole.

Example: "Excellent customer service, attention to detail and persistence are my strengths. When I started working in hospitality, I learned that attentiveness to a customer's needs makes them feel valued and helps you learn how to serve them better. It also helps create a positive customer experience. Another strength of mine is how I'm persistent about making sure to complete a task. It's important to me that I complete tasks to the standards set by the organization and my personal standard of excellent work. These three attributes work together to make me a strong customer advocate."

### 2. Tell us about your educational experience

Interviewers ask this question to determine if you have the specific experience and education needed to perform the job duties for which you're applying. For example, if you're applying for a copywriting position, the hiring manager likely wants to hear that you have a bachelor's degree in English, writing, journalism or a related field. While you don't need to divulge every bit of education and experience you've ever received, be sure to include all relevant information that supports your ability to excel in the position.
The following are examples of education and experience to include in your answer to this question:
Your degrees
Any diplomas you've received, such as those from a polytechnic college
Any certifications you've obtained that support your ability to succeed in the position

Example: "I earned my software development degree at Mountain National University in Brazil. During my final semester, I completed an internship with Jensen Software as a development specialist. After graduating, Jensen Software offered me a full-time position where I worked for three years. I also completed my cloud computing certification while working in that position, which I feel prepares me to take on a role within this organization."

### 3. Why are you interested in this position?

Many interviewers ask applicants why they're interested in the position or the company. When answering this question, it's important to focus on how your abilities and experience can benefit the company and position. You can also discuss that you want to grow with the company, as many employers want to hire employees who plan to stay with the business for at least five years.

Example: "I'm interested in this position because I want to be part of an organization that values its employees and what they contribute to the workplace. I'm interested in your collaborative idea platform and emphasis on personal growth through professional development. I want to earn additional industry certifications and believe this position can help me achieve my goals while contributing to the company's mission." 

### 4. Why should we hire you?

Employers often ask this question to determine whether a candidate fully understands the requirements of the position and gauge their ability to meet those requirements. A great way to prepare for this question is to study the job listing and the requirements for the position based on the employer's job posting language. List which of your abilities correspond with these requirements and use these in your answer.

Example: "I feel you should hire me because I have the experience to take on this role and the dedication and passion to lead a team of professionals. My skills in collaborative problem-solving and project management make me a strong leader. If you choose me for this position, I'm ready to use my expertise to encourage my team to create a better product that reflects the quality this company consistently delivers to consumers."
